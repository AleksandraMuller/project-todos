# Project Todos built using React Redux :pencil:

In this project I use React with Redux to build a todo app.

In my todo app, you are able to add tasks, toggle them whether a task is done/ important or not. It is possible to delete a single task or delete a complete list of tasks. In the sidebar, you can also filter the list to show only completed or uncompleted tasks.

## In this project, you will find:

- Redux store
- Reducers and actions
- Interaction with store using selectors and by dispatching actions

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning ðŸ”¨

I used functional React to build this project. The project is divided into multiple Components. If I had more time, I would add a due date to a task and add more filters. I would also spend even more time on styling.

## Deployed version ðŸš€
